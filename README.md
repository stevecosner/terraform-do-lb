# terraform-do-lb
Terraform project for setting up the Digital Ocean load balancer and 3 web servers.

Run the terraform project.

Login to Digital Ocean console and add the web servers to the load balancer.  Just a few clicks...

The Git project that clones onto the web servers is from a docker load balancer project.  We are using it for the edited Nginx index.html files here.
